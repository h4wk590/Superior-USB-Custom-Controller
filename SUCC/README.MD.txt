# Superior USB Custom Controller

The Succ is a USB switch board powered by the TEENSY Arduino 3.2. It's for users looking to get into flight simulator 
games without forking out $$$ for more advanced equipment.

This was a university project from my Project Management class. 

**The main goals were:**

-To understand how Sprints work within a technoloy setting as a Project Manager
-To enhance collaborative abilities with a group of people to meet a due date
-To build a bomb-a** USB controller, and learn some new skills along the way

## Design

The first steps we took in this project were:

-What type of micro-controller we were going to use
-What the end design would look like
-How it would be wired together
